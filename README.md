# AndroidConfigurationChanges

## Introduction
It’s been two years since I wrote about a clean Android architecture in this article (https://medium.com/@manuelvicnt/rxjava-android-mvvm-app-structure-with-retrofit-a5605fa32c00). 
A year after that one, I leveraged it with a slightly different approach and making it lifecycle-aware in this other article. (https://medium.com/@manuelvicnt/rxjava2-android-mvvm-lifecycle-app-structure-with-retrofit-2-cf903849f49e) 

Now it’s time to close the circle and make it survive configuration changes.

## Explanation
You can find how it works in this article written in Medium:
